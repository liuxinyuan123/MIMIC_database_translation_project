MIMIC is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and [our collaborators](/docs/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. We therefore encourage MIMIC users to work together as a community.
The [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/) contains collaboratively developed code for a large number of useful concepts in MIMIC.
The discussions page provides a forum for [public discussion](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/discussions) which reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and full transparency around discussions.
