## If I notice a problem, how do I raise an issue on the MIMIC Code Repository?

To raise an issue, first navigate to the [MIMIC Code Repository issues page](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues).
After logging in to GitHub, click "New issue", add a title and description of the problem, and then select the "Submit new issue" button.

## How do I ask questions about MIMIC?

Discussions can be used to seek advice for how to do something within the MIMIC ecosystem. If you have a question about how to do something but don't think there is a problem with the code you can use [discussions](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/discussions) instead of issues. If you know the answer to a question being asked in discussions we appreciate you taking the time to answer it!
