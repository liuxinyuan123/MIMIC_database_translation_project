## *poe_detail*

The *poe_detail* table provides further information on POE orders. The table uses an Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model: the entity is `poe_id`, the attribute is `field_name`, and the value is `field_value`.
EAV tables allow for flexible description of entities when the attributes are heterogenous.

## Table columns

| Name          | Postgres data type    |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| `poe_id`      | VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL  |
| `poe_seq`     | INTEGER NOT NULL      |
| `subject_id`  | INTEGER NOT NULL      |
| `field_name`  | VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL |
| `field_value` | TEXT                  |

### `poe_id`

A unique identifier for the given order. `poe_id` is composed of `subject_id` and a monotonically increasing integer, `poe_seq`, in the following format: `subject_id`-`poe_seq`.

### `poe_seq`

A monotonically increasing integer which chronologically sorts the POE orders. That is, POE orders can be ordered sequentially by `poe_seq`.

### `subject_id`

{{% include "/static/include/subject_id.md" %}}

### `field_name`

Each row provides detail regarding a particular aspect of a POE order. `field_name` is the name given to that aspect.
As of MIMIC-IV v2.2, the following table lists the possible values and the most common entry for it in `field_value`.

### `field_value`

`field_value` is the value associated with the given POE order and `field_name`. For example, for the `field_name` of 'Admit to', the `field_value` column contains the type of unit the patient was admitted to (Psychiatry, GYN, and so on).
