  Detailed information about hospital stays.

The *admissions* table gives information regarding a patient's admission to the hospital. Since each unique hospital visit for a patient is assigned a unique `hadm_id`, the *admissions* table can be considered as a definition table for `hadm_id`. Information available includes timing information for admission and discharge, demographic information, the source of the admission, and so on.

### Links to

* *patients* on `subject_id`

## Important considerations

* The data is sourced from the admission, discharge and transfer database from the hospital (often referred to as 'ADT' data).
* Organ donor accounts are sometimes created for patients who died in the hospital. These are distinct hospital admissions with very short, sometimes negative lengths of stay. Furthermore, their `deathtime` is frequently the same as the earlier patient admission's `deathtime`.

## Detailed description

The *admissions* table defines all hospitalizations in the database. Hospitalizations are assigned a unique random integer known as the `hadm_id`.

### `subject_id`, `hadm_id`

Each row of this table contains a unique `hadm_id`, which represents a single patient's admission to the hospital. `hadm_id` ranges from 2000000 - 2999999. It is possible for this table to have duplicate `subject_id`, indicating that a single patient had multiple admissions to the hospital. The ADMISSIONS table can be linked to the PATIENTS table using `subject_id`.

### `admittime`, `dischtime`, `deathtime`

`admittime` provides the date and time the patient was admitted to the hospital, while `dischtime` provides the date and time the patient was discharged from the hospital. If applicable, `deathtime` provides the time of in-hospital death for the patient. Note that `deathtime` is only present if the patient died in-hospital, and is almost always the same as the patient's `dischtime`. However, there can be some discrepancies due to typographical errors.

### `admission_type`

`admission_type` is useful for classifying the urgency of the admission. There are 9 possibilities: 'AMBULATORY OBSERVATION', 'DIRECT EMER.', 'DIRECT OBSERVATION', 'ELECTIVE', 'EU OBSERVATION', 'EW EMER.', 'OBSERVATION ADMIT', 'SURGICAL SAME DAY ADMISSION', 'URGENT'.

### `admit_provider_id`

`admit_provider_id` provides an anonymous identifier for the provider who admitted the patient.

### `admission_location`, `discharge_location`

`admission_location` provides information about the location of the patient prior to arriving at the hospital. Note that as the emergency room is technically a clinic, patients who are admitted via the emergency room usually have it as their admission location.

Similarly, `discharge_location` is the disposition of the patient after they are discharged from the hospital.

#### Association with UB-04 billing codes

`admission_location` and `discharge_location` are associated with internal hospital `ibax` codes which aren't provided in MIMIC-IV. These internal codes tend to align with UB-04 billing codes. 

In some cases more than one internal code is associated with a given `admission_location` and `discharge_location`. This can either be do to; 1) multiple codes being used by the hospital for the same `admission_location` or `discharge_location`, or 2) during de-identification multiple internal codes may be combined into a single `admission_location` or `discharge_location`. 

In the tables below, we provide the matching UB-04 code(s) for the most common `ibax` codes for a given `admission_location` and `discharge_location`, when applicable. In cases where more than one code is given, if this combination is due to 1) in the above paragraph, the additional code must have at least 10% of the entires of the most common code. 

Admission UB-04 mappings:
admission_location | UB-04 code(s)

PHYSICIAN REFERRAL | 1, 3

UB-04 documentation online often provides more detail than found in the `admission_location` and `discharge_location` text, particularly for discharges.

### `insurance`, `language`, `marital_status`, `ethnicity`

The `insurance`, `language`, `marital_status`, and `ethnicity` columns provide information about patient demographics for the given hospitalization.
Note that as this data is documented for each hospital admission, they may change from stay to stay.

### `edregtime`, `edouttime`

The date and time at which the patient was registered and discharged from the emergency department.

### `hospital_expire_flag`

This is a binary flag which indicates whether the patient died within the given hospitalization. `1` indicates death in the hospital, and `0` indicates survival to hospital discharge.
