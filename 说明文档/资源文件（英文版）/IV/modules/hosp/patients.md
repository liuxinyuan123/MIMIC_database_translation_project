  Patients' gender, age, and date of death if information exists.

Information that is consistent for the lifetime of a patient is stored in this table.

## Table columns

| Name                | Postgres data type    |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| `subject_id`        | INTEGER NOT NULL      |
| `gender`            | VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL   |
| `anchor_age`        | INTEGER NOT NULL      |
| `anchor_year`       | INTEGER NOT NULL      |
| `anchor_year_group` | VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL |
| `dod`               | TIMESTAMP(0)          |

## Detailed Description

### `subject_id`

`subject_id` is a unique identifier which specifies an individual patient. Any rows associated with a single `subject_id` pertain to the same individual. As `subject_id` is the primary key for the table, it is unique for each row. 

### `gender`

`gender` is the genotypical sex of the patient.

### `anchor_age`, `anchor_year`, `anchor_year_group`

These columns provide information regarding the actual patient year for the patient admission, and the patient's age at that time.

* `anchor_year` is a shifted year for the patient.
* `anchor_year_group` is a range of years - the patient's `anchor_year` occurred during this range.
* `anchor_age` is the patient's age in the `anchor_year`. If a patient's `anchor_age` is over 89 in the `anchor_year` then their `anchor_age` is set to 91, regardless of how old they actually were.
* Example: a patient has an `anchor_year` of 2153, `anchor_year_group` of 2008 - 2010, and an `anchor_age` of 60.
  * The year 2153 for the patient corresponds to 2008, 2009, or 2010.
  * The patient was 60 in the shifted year of 2153, i.e. they were 60 in 2008, 2009, or 2010.
  * A patient admission in 2154 will occur in 2009-2011, an admission in 2155 will occur in 2010-2012, and so on.

### `dod`

The de-identified date of death for the patient. Date of death is extracted from two sources: the hospital information system and the [Massachusetts State Registry of Vital Records and Statistics](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/registry-of-vital-records-and-statistics).
Individual patient records from MIMIC were matched to the vital records using a custom algorithm based on identifiers including name, social security number, and date of birth.

As a result of the linkage, out of hospital mortality is available for MIMIC-IV patients up to **one year post-hospital discharge**. All patient deaths occurring more than one year after hospital discharge are censored.
Survival studies should incorporate this into their design.
